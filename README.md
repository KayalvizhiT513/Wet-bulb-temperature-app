# Wet Bulb Temperature Visualization

🚀 **Description:**
Interactive visualization of wet bulb temperature, temperature, and humidity for coastal cities in India. Highlights critical thresholds and provides insights into heat stress management.

🔧 **Features:**
- Interactive Graphs: Visualizes wet bulb temperature against temperature and humidity dynamically.
- Real-time Data: Fetches current weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- Threshold Alerts: Highlights cities exceeding critical thresholds (e.g., 32°C and 35°C).
- Dynamic City Management: Users can add/remove cities for customized analysis.
- Educational Insights: Provides information on wet bulb temperature implications for heat stress.

🛠️ **Tools and Technologies:**
- Python
- Streamlit
- Requests
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
